    Im Jovan Milicev, a Business Intelligence & Reporting Analyst at Metrolinx with a strong foundation in Computer Science from York University. My path in technology began with a passion for problem-solving and innovation, which led me to develop my first Java-based game in middle school. Over time, my interests expanded into areas like data analysis, procurement, and full-stack development, shaping a diverse career grounded in technology and business intelligence.
